# To-do's

- Go to earlier month

## Budget chart:

- Prettify the "Estimated spend at end of month" and maybe add a Euro symbol
- Have an option at the top to toggle between sparkbar view (as it is now) and "table" view, where there would be entries for: total remaining in month, average remaining per day, etc.
- Expand top transactions

## History chart

- General refactor of code 
- Prettier layout of configuration options & chart
- Bigger font size in chart
- Clearer language between "previous year" and "last 12 months" etc.
- Stable configuration when changing time frame (i.e. persist configuration in browser during update of data from YNAB)
- Add a footnote asterix to "one-off"
